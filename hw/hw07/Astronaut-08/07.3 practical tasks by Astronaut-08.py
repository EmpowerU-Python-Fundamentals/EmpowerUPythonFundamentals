'''Practical tasks by Astronaut-08'''

#TASK 1 Jenny's secret message
#Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user.
#However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different.
#She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.


#TASK 2 Find The Distance Between Two Points
#Given two ordered pairs calculate the distance between them.
#Round to two decimal places.
#This should be easy to do in 0(1) timing.


#TASK 3 No yelling!
#Write a function taking in a string like WOW this is REALLY
#amazing and returning Wow this is really amazing.
#String should be capitalized and properly spaced.
#Using re and string is not allowed.
#Examples:
#filter_words('HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME') #=> Hello can you hear me
#filter_words('now THIS is REALLY interesting') #=> Now this is really interesting
#filter_words('THAT was EXTRAORDINARY!') #=> That was extraordinary!


#TASK 4 Convert a Number to a String!
#We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.
#What ways of achieving this do you know?
#Examples (input --> output):
#123  --> "123"
#999  --> "999"
#-100 --> "-100"


#TASK 5 Reversing Words in a String
#You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string.
#Words are always separated by a single space.
#As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.
#Example (Input --> Output)
#"Hello World" --> "World Hello"
#"Hi There." --> "There. Hi"
#Happy coding!


#TASK 6 Reverse List Order
#In this kata you will create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the
#reverse order.
#Examples (Input -> Output)
#* [1, 2, 3, 4]  -> [4, 3, 2, 1]
#* [9, 2, 0, 7]  -> [7, 0, 2, 9]


#TASK 7 Multiples of 3 or 5
#If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6
#and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
#Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below
#the number passed in.
#Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.
#Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.


#TASK 8 Will you make it?
#You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back,
#you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away!
#You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons
#left.
#Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to
#the pump or not.
#Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.


#TASK 9 Are You Playing Banjo?
#Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
#If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!
#The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:
#name + " plays banjo" 
#name + " does not play banjo"
#Names given are always valid strings.


#TASK 10 Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'No'.
#Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a "Yes" string for true, or a
#"No" string for false.


#TASK 11
#TASK 12
